Welcome to my edition of **The Best Thing I Ever Ate** (based off of [this Food Network show](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/the-best-thing-i-ever-ate)). Here, I highlight where to go and what to get. Note I'm based in NY so many of my recommendations reflect that.

Burgers
: [Ruby's - Murray Hill / Soho, NY](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rubys-murray-hill-new-york) : I take everyone I know here because their **Bronte** burger is just *out of this world*. It's a thick, juicy, and flavorful beef patty layered with a slightly tangy and sweet chili sauce, sandwiched in between two grilled panini slices. I overdid it with the description only because it's *that good*. Don't forget that side of **fries**! They're perfectly fried and served with a truffle aioli. If you're on the healthier side, their salads never disappoint.

Shanghai
: [21 Shanghai House - Chinatown, NY](https://www.yelp.com/biz/21-shanghai-house-new-york-4) : This place does great **soup dumplings** (probably my favorite), pan-fried dumplings, pork buns, **Shanghai noodles**, *fall-off-the-bone* ribs, and **vege dishes**! And the prices are super affordable - huge plus in my book.

Italian
: [Lavagna - East Village, NY](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lavagna-restaurant-new-york) : This quaint and (what I believe to be) authentically Italian restaurant does no wrong when it comes to their scallop appetizer or their pastas, especially their famous **rigatoni** in an orange, cream sauce tossed with sausage and peas. Plus, their service is impeccable.

Ice Cream
: [Kiddos Creamery - Glendale, CA](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kiddos-creamery-glendale) : This Los Angles-based shop gave me one of my most memorable ice cream experiences with their **Tahitian vanilla and white coffee** flavor. It was a *close your eyes and just appreciate life* kind of moment.
: [Soft Swerve - LES, NY](https://www.yelp.com/biz/soft-swerve-new-york-2) : I come here whenever I need my **black sesame** soft serve fix. It's got a strong, nutty flavor, and a super creamy texture. Their ube and green tea flavors are equally delicious.

Pie
: [Pie Hole - Multiple locations in Los Angeles](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pie-hole-los-angeles-3) : I've only been here once and got the **Earl Grey** (loved how strong the flavor was) and **Apple Crumble** (warm, juicy apples with a buttery crust and crumbly crumble). Salivating just thinking about them.

Coffee
: [12 Corners - LES, NY](https://www.yelp.com/biz/12-corners-coffee-new-york) : This has been my favorite coffee shop for years. It's quiet, cozy, unpretentious, never too crowded, has friendly staff - the list goes on and on. And to keep going on, they've got great coffee (Kobrick's) and pastries (donuts from Dough).
