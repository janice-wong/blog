Hello! My name is Janice and I'm a web developer, born, raised, and living in NYC. I recently graduated a coding bootcamp called Actualize, mainly focusing on Ruby and Javascript. Previously, I received my Bachelor's in Math and Master's in Math Ed from Rutgers, taught Math to high school students, and am now a Project Manager at a global bank as well as a web development apprentice at an organization that caters to nonprofits through technology.

Nowadays, you can find me at [12 Corner's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/12-corners-coffee-new-york) continuing to build my portfolio, stuffing my face at [Ruby's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rubys-murray-hill-new-york), or (as you may have already guessed) salsa dancing!
