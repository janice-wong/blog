Hello! My name is Janice and I'm a web developer, born, raised, and living in NYC. I recently graduated a coding bootcamp called Actualize, which focused mainly on Ruby and JS. Previously, I received my Bachelor's in Math and Master's in Math Ed from Rutgers, taught Math to high school students, and am currently:
* A Technical Project Manager at a global bank,
* A Web Developer at an organization that serves nonprofits through tech,
* A freelance Web Developer, and
* A Teaching Assistant for Actualize.

Nowadays, you can find me at [12 Corner's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/12-corners-coffee-new-york) continuing to build my portfolio, stuffing my face at [Ruby's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rubys-murray-hill-new-york), or (as you may have already guessed) salsa dancing!
