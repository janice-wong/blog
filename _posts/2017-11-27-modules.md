title: What's a module?
description: >
  Defining and giving examples of modules

Modules serve as mechanisms for **namespaces** and **multiple inheritance**.

Let's talk about **namespaces** first. Say you want to build a croissant app, so you create the following class:

```ruby
class Croissant
  def self.best
    p "I am the best pastry out there"
  end
end

Croissant.best #=> "I am the best pastry out there"
```
You find a gem you want to use that returns information about croissants. Unfortunately, that gem also uses a Croissant class, and including that code in your app might be disastrous. Using other people's code happens *all* the time, so modules are used as namespaces. This is how you use one:

```ruby
module SomeNamespace
  class Croissant
    def self.best
      p "I am the best pastry out there"
    end
  end
end

SomeNamespace::Croissant.best #=> "I am the best pastry out there"
```

You can see examples of these modules in almost every gem you use! Look at the one below from one of my favorite gems, Faker:

```ruby
module Faker
  class Food < Base
    class << self
      def dish
        fetch('food.dish')
      end

      ...


    end
  end
end

Faker::Food.dish #=> "Caesar Salad"
```

Modules are also used for **multiple inheritance** - these modules' only purpose is to hold methods that are *inherited* by *multiple* classes. Let's say you've got a Car class and a Bike class. Both use a `brake` method which updates `@speed = 0`. Instead of including the `brake` method in both classes, we can just put it in `module Moveable` and include the `Moveable` module in both classes. Check it out:

```ruby
module Moveable
  def brake
    @speed = 0
  end
end

class Car
  include Moveable
  attr_reader :speed

  def initialize(input)
    @speed = input[:speed]
  end
end

class Bike
  include Moveable
  attr_reader :speed

  def initialize(input)
    @speed = input[:speed]
  end
end

car = Car.new(speed: 10)
bike = Bike.new(speed: 5)

p car.speed #=> 10
p bike.speed #=> 5
car.brake
bike.brake
p car.speed #=> 0
p bike.speed #=> 0
```
2 things to note:
1. These modules always end in "able".
2. The main difference between modules and classes is that they cannot be instantiated

```ruby
Moveable.new #=> NoMethodError: undefined method ‘new’ for Moveable:Module
```

Hopefully, this gave you a sufficient overview of modules, when, and how to use them. Thanks to [RyanSobol's gist](https://gist.github.com/ryansobol/5252653) for the inspiration for this post!
